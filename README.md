## Overview
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Description

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## App Setup

* Create a GitHub repo called burger and clone it to your computer.


* Make a package.json file by running npm init from the command line.


* Install the Express npm package: npm install express.


* Create a server.js file.


* Install the Handlebars npm package: npm install express-handlebars.


* Install MySQL npm package: npm install mysql.


* Require the following npm packages inside of the server.js file:

* express

## Technologies
 * Javascript
 * node.js
 * MySQL 
 * Express
 * handlebars

## Usage
  * Run seed file in MySQL Workbench or an equivalent if you would like starting data.
  * Run node server.js in your terminal to start the application.
